This project is based on the original Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, it will use the traditional format and sequence of the game. This is my NEA Project for my Computer Science A Level.

I have wanted to keep the game as original as possible so I have used real questions and answers in my project and wanted to use the same lifeline that are in the game. That being said I have also added a few extra features into the program to make it more interesting as well as more complex. 

These features are:
          
            ~ login system
            ~ leaderboard
            ~ graphs
            ~ encryption (didn't work in the end)
            
I was also only able to implement one lifeline (call a friend) due to time contstraints and deadlines around the project.

All of the code and description of it is in detail in the word document attached, it includes 5 stages; analysis, design, technical solution, testing and evaluation. It is very depth and that is the component that is being sent off to the exam board to get my grade, if you would like to view everything about the program including its background and evaluation then please read the document.
